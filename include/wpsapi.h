 * \section main-install Installation
 *
 * For installation instructions please read \ref installation.
 *
 * \section api API Summary
 *
 * \li \c WPS_location()
 * \li \c WPS_periodic_location()
 * \li \c WPS_tiling()
 *
 * For the full description of the API please read \ref API.
 *
 * \defgroup API API
 *
 * The API works in 2 major modes: \e network centric and \e device centric.
 * In addition the \e tiling mode is a mix of the two.
 *
 * \section network_model Network-centric mode
 * In the network-centric model the API issues calls to a remote server
 * to determine a location.
 *
 * This is the mode used by the \c WPS_location() call.
 *
 * If a path to a local file has been setup (See \c WPS_set_local_files_path()),
 * the API first tries to determine the location locally,
 * without calling the remote server. This is called the \e mixed-mode model.
 *
 * \section device_model Device-centric mode
 * In the device-centric model the API determines location
 * locally.
 *
 * This is the mode used by the \c WPS_periodic_location() call.
 *
 * This mode is activated by setting the path to a local
 * file. See \c WPS_set_local_files_path().
 *
 * \section tiling_model Tiling mode
 * The tiling mode is a mix of the network and device-centric mode.
 * It downloads from the server a small portion of the database so
 * the device can automonously determine its location, without further
 * need to contact the server.
 *
 * This mode is activated by calling \c WPS_tiling().
 *

 *
 * \section logginghowto How to turn on logging
 *
 * \if winxp
 *   On Windows XP either drop a file named \c wpslog.properties
 *   in the directory containing the executable that loads WPS,
 *   or define an environment variable named \c WPS_LOG_CONFIGURATION
 *   that contains the path to the \c wpslog.properties file.
 * \elseif vista
 *   On Windows Vista either drop a file named \c wpslog.properties
 *   in the directory containing the executable that loads WPS,
 *   or define an environment variable named \c WPS_LOG_CONFIGURATION
 *   that contains the path to the \c wpslog.properties file.
 * \elseif pocketpc
 *   On Windows Mobile/CE drop a file named \c wpslog.properties
 *   in the directory containing the executable that loads WPS.
 *   For the VirtualGPS this directory is \c \\Windows as
 *   WPS is loaded as a service by \c services.exe.
 * \elseif linux
 *   On Linux define an environment variable named \c WPS_LOG_CONFIGURATION
 *   that contains the path to the \c wpslog.properties file.
 * \elseif darwin
 *   On Mac OS X define an environment variable named \c WPS_LOG_CONFIGURATION
 *   that contains the path to the \c wpslog.properties file.
 * \elseif symbian
 *   On Symbian OS create a folder \c C:\\Logs\\WPSAPI in phone memory.
 *   The log file is written to \c C:\\Logs\\WPSAPI\\wpslog.txt if that folder exists.
 * \endif
 *
 * \ifnot symbian
 *   \section wpslog WPS log properties file
 *
 *   Here's an example of a \c wpslog.properties file:
 *   \if winxp
 *     \verbatim DEBUG,wpslog.txt \endverbatim
 *   \elseif vista
 *     \verbatim DEBUG,wpslog.txt \endverbatim
 *   \elseif pocketpc
 *     \verbatim DEBUG,\wpslog.txt \endverbatim
 *   \elseif linux
 *     \verbatim DEBUG,wpslog.txt \endverbatim
 *   \elseif darwin
 *     \verbatim DEBUG,wpslog.txt \endverbatim
 *   \endif
 * \endif
 *
 * \ifnot symbian
 *   You can also redirect logging to \c stdout or \c stderr:
 *     \verbatim DEBUG,stdout \endverbatim
 *
 *   The logging level can be one of the following:
 *
 *   \li FATAL
 *   \li INFO
 *   \li ALERT
 *   \li CRITICAL
 *   \li ERROR
 *   \li WARN
 *   \li NOTICE
 *   \li INFO
